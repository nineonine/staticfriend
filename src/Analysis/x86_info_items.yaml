OperationSuffixes: |
  GAS assembly instructions are generally suffixed with the letters "b", "s", "w", "l", "q" or "t" to determine what size operand is being manipulated.
    b = byte (8 bit).
    s = single (32-bit floating point).
    w = word (16 bit).
    l = long (32 bit integer or 64-bit floating point).
    q = quad (64 bit).
    t = ten bytes (80-bit floating point).
  If the suffix is not specified, and there are no memory operands for the instruction, GAS infers the operand size from the size of the destination register operand (the final operand).
